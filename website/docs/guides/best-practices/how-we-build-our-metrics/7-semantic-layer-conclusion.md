## Putting it all together

## Best practices

## Next steps

- Map out a clear plan for your dbt project to incrementally adopt the Semantic Layer.
- Get involved in the community and ask questions, help craft best practices, and share your progress in building a dbt Semantic Layer.

The dbt Semantic Layer is the biggest paradigm shift thus far in the young practice of analytics engineering. It's ready to provide value right away, but is most impactful if you move your project towards increasing normalization, and allow MetricFlow to do the denormalization for you with maximum dimensionality.
